      The Red Hat Summit Competition is a one off competition on the 9th October at the The Mermaid, 
      2 Puddle Dock, London EC4V 3DB, UK.
      Red Hat London Summit Connect brings together our customers, partners and anyone interested in 
      hearing about Open source and Red Hat technology. 
      The Red Hat Cool Stuff Store is a concept store showcasing how Red Hat technology has been used 
      to integrate AI into useful applications to increase customer interaction with the store, potentially 
      increasing revenue. 
      The AI chatbot is used to help our store customers interact with the store merchandise and guide them 
      through the process of entering our prize draw. 
      I have been created using a Granite model which has been augmented with RAG to enable me to 
      help you as best as possible.
      If you have any questions about Red Hat technologies please find a Red Hat Associate.
