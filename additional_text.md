Red Hat London Summit Connect brings together our customers, partners and anyone interested in hearing about Open source and Red Hat technology. 

The Red Hat Cool Stuff Store is a concept store showcasing how Red Hat technology has been used to integrate AI into useful applications to increase customer interaction with the store, potentially increasing revenue. 

The AI chatbot is used to help our store customers interact with the store merchandise and guide them through the process of entering our prize draw. 

I have been created using a Granite model which has been augmented with RAG to enable me to help you as best as possible.
