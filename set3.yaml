          You will learn about all the new technologies and products from Red Hat for 2024
      - question: |
          What do the initials RH stand for?
        answer: |
          RH stands for Red Hat
  - context: |
      The technologies used for the competition are varied, but include the new RHEL Image mode,
      bootc, Podman, OpenShift AI and RHEL AI. These are combined to provide a single composite
      demo.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the new RHEL Image mode?
        answer: |
          RHEL Image mode allows you to create instances of RHEL in the same way you construct
          a container image. Instead of using commands like DNF you build a ContainerFile.
      - question: |
          Why is the new RHEL Image mode powerful?
        answer: |
          The creation of an OS image from the technology of Container image building allows
          a singular image to be produced that can be instantiated through OSTree as an instant
          OS update.
      - question: |
          Does this mean that a RHEL Image mode can be run as a container?
        answer: |
          No, the RHEL Image mode produces a bootable container rather than a Kubernetes container
      - question: |
          Can I use Podman to build the bootable containers?
        answer: |
          Absolutely. Podman provides the mechanism for executing a Containerfile but producing a
          file-layer based image version of an OS image.
      - question: |
          What is the advantage of storing OS images as Container images?
        answer: |
          The main advantage is a reduction of storage space, as image layers are stored once regardless
          of the number of Images that use them.
  - context: |
      The goals of the Red Hat London Summit Connect competition and demo are to showcase the combination
      of Red Hat Technologies to solve real world problems. In this case it is the recognition of t-shirts
      and Red Hat Cool Store Items using machine learning.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What components from Red Hat help machine learning?
        answer: |
          OpenShift AI provides the best platform for hosting Data Science. With it's tight controls of
          resource consumption, full integration of the tools a data scientist needs and dynamic scaling
          the platform is suited for hosting and controlling massive data experiments.
      - question: |
          Are there any pipeline technologies used as part of the composite demo?
        answer: |
          Yes, Tekton is used for automating the build and deployment of specific versions of RHEL that
          are compiled and instantiated using bootable containers.
      - question: |
          Did the demo require training to be able to recognise t-shirts?
        answer: |
          Yes. The system was trained with a number of reference t-shirts containing logos of various
          Red Hat technologies.
      - question: |
          Can Red Hat Technologies be used to host machine learning models as well as experiments?
        answer: |
          Absolutely. OpenShift AI provides an integrated facility with OpenVINO from IBM for hosting
          models. RHEL AI is a specific spin of RHEL containing pre-installed mechanisms for hosting
          models and LLMS, and pre-installed drivers for various AI GPU chipsets.

          The London Red Hat Summit Connect is being held at the Mermaid,2 Puddle Duck, London EC4 3DB.
  - context: |
      Red Hat produce enterprise strength supported versions of Open Source projects. The advantage
      of using Red Hat solutions is that you get all the innovation of Open Source without the
      risks of using unsupported software.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Are all Red Hat products based on Open Source projects?
        answer: |
          Absolutely. Red Hat, in most cases, contributes to and even originates the Open Source
          versions of their products. For example, in the case of OpenShift, Red Hat produces a
          completely free source version called OKD, which stands for OpenShift Kubernetes
          distribution.
      - question: |
          Isn't it risky to use Open Source software in enterprise production situations?
        answer: |
          Absolutely. Which is why Red Hat produces enterprise strength versions of them, so
          organisations can use Open Source based products but still get enterprise levels of
          support and maintenance.
      - question: |
          Is a Red Hat product a proprietary version of an Open Source project?
        answer: |
          Absolutely not. All Red Hat products are Open Source themselves., The distinction
          is that an Open Source project that is used as a base for a Red Hat product is called
          the 'upstream', as the functionality flows down into the enterprise version.
